# Genetic Algorithm - Robby the Robot

Use this application to generate solutions to the following: Robby, a garbage collecting robot needs to travel his grid world to collect as many cans as possible. This application implements a genetic algorithm through which Robby's move patterns are evaluated by running him through test grids. Solutions are saved to files which can then be visualized in the RobbyVisualizer monogame application.


Uses the dotnet framework.


## Usage
Go to RobbyIterationGenerator to create solution files
then.
```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
Go to RobbyVisualizer to run the monogame animation using your solution files or the ones already included in the repository.
```
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```
